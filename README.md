# 🎧 Faceit Demo Voice Audio Bitfield Calculator

Hello dear Counter-Strike friends,  
my name is Musti, also known as **Pythaeus**.

I created this software to make it easier to listen to players in Faceit demos.  
I was inspired by the YouTuber **[@KEROVSKI](https://www.youtube.com/@KEROVSKI_)** and his tool — so I decided to build something even better. 😉

For reading demo files, I used the **[DemoFile](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DemoFile/)** library, which requires several additional dependencies (linked below).

ps: I always scan with Virus-Total and hybrid-analysis, some Windows systems complain because I don't include a certificate.
